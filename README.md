This project is my final project as a Software Engineering Practical Engineer student.
It is a web-based CRM and ticket management system designed to handle customer support requests efficiently.
The system includes features such as user authentication, ticket creation and tracking, role-based access, and a built-in support chatbot.
Developed using PHP, MySQL, and modern front-end technologies.
